## My process

As basic as this challenge might be for experienced developers, for me it's all abouta getting in a brand new work and not giving up.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Well, this was more about putting all my new learnings together rather than learning something new. Maybe the learning is that I need to keep going!

### Continued development

Everything, hopefully soon I can add som JS to my projects.
